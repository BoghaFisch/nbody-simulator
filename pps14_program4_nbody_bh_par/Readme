2) A parallel N*logN program using the Barnes-Hut method.

SOURCE CODE: /src/
COMPILED: /bin/

main: In Main-class

___________________________________________

HOW TO RUN:

Either compile the files in the /src/ folder, or run the already compiled files in /bin/.

The following is the form for running the program:

java Main [gnumBodies] [numSteps] [far] [numWorkers]

___________________________________________

ARGS:

[gnumBodies]
- The number of bodies to be used.
- Default 120 bodies.
- Since the file read from only contains 300 bodies, it can at max be set to 300.

[numSteps]
- Number of timesteps.
- Default is set to 17000.

[far]
- Constant for when to approximate or not.
- The higher value, the more approximations are made.
- Default set to 2.1.

[numWorkers]
- The number of workers to be used.
- Default is 2.

EXAMPLES

java Main 200
- Runs the program with 200 bodies, 17000 timesteps [default], 2.1 as far [default] and 2 workers [default].

java Main 200 10000
- Runs the program with 200 bodies and 10000 timesteps. Far is 2.1 [default] and numWorkers is 2 [default].

java Main 200 10000 1
- Runs the program with 200 bodies, 10000 timesteps and far set to 1. numWorkers is 2 [default].

java Main 200 10000 1 4
- Runs the program with 200 bodies, 10000 timesteps, far 2.1 and 4 workers.

java Main
- 120 bodies, 17000 timesteps, far set to 2.1 and 2 workers [all default]
