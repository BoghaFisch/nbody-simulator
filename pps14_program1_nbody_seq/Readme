2) A sequential N^2 program

SOURCE CODE: /src/
COMPILED: /bin/

main: In Main-class

___________________________________________

HOW TO RUN:

Either compile the files in the /src/ folder, or run the already compiled files in /bin/.

The following is the form for running the program:

java Main [gnumBodies] [numSteps]

___________________________________________

ARGS:

[gnumBodies]
- The number of bodies to be used.
- Default 120 bodies.
- Since the file read from only contains 300 bodies, it can at max be set to 300.

[numSteps]
- Number of timesteps.
- Default is set to 17000.
__________________________________________

EXAMPLES

java Main 200
- Runs the program with 200 bodies and 17000 timesteps [default]

java Main 200 10000
- Runs the program with 200 bodies and 10000 timesteps.

java Main
- 120 bodies and 17000 timesteps [both default]
