# nbody-simulator
A performance comparison between a set of parallel and sequential algorithms for gravitational n-body simulation.

The algorithms implemented and compared were the following:

    1) A sequential O(N^2) program.

    2) A parallelized O(N^2) program.

    3) A sequential O(N*log N) program using the Barnes-Hut method.

    4) A parallelized O(N*log N) program using the Barnes-Hut method.

For more details on the results and implementation, see the report (<a href="https://github.com/BoghaFisch/nbody-simulator/blob/master/nbody_project_lindstrom_david.pdf"  target="_blank">nbody_project_lindstrom_david.pdf</a>)
