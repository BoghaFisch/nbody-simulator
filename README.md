# nbody-simulator
A performance comparison between a set of parallel and sequential algorithms for gravitational n-body simulation.

The algorithms compared were the following:

1) A sequential O(N^2) program.

2) A parallelized O(N^2) program.

3) A sequential O(N*log N) program using the Barnes-Hut method.

4) A parallelized O(N*log N) program using the Barnes-Hut method.

For more details on the results and implementation, see the report (nbody_project_lindstrom_david.pdf)
