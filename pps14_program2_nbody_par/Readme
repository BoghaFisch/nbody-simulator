2) A parallel N^2 program

SOURCE CODE: /src/
COMPILED: /bin/

main: In Main-class

___________________________________________

HOW TO RUN:

Either compile the files in the /src/ folder, or run the already compiled files in /bin/.

The following is the form for running the program:

java Main [gnumBodies] [numSteps] [numWorkers]

___________________________________________

ARGS:

[gnumBodies]
- The number of bodies to be used.
- Default 120 bodies.
- Since the file read from only contains 300 bodies, it can at max be set to 300.

[numSteps]
- Number of timesteps.
- Default is set to 17000.

[numWorkers]
- The number of workers to be used.
- Default is set to 2.
